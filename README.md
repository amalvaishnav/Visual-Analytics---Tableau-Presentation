Brief Description:

My Dataset helps people who are moving to London for the first time. It allows people to define an area or neighborhood of interest and pulls back an up-to-date range of data important to decision making when moving house.
My work  will help make a decision buying house for the following concerns in London:

Affordable house with the rent in budget 
Select the area where schools and banks are nearby
Select the area which is safer
